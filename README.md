# My Portfolio Website :rocket:

## Purpose and Vision
I originally started this website as a front end project at the Sparta Global Academy. Since then I have been adding content and features to it, as my portfolio has grown. I often like to make tweaks to this website as an exercise to keep my front end skills fresh.

Since my completion of the Sparta Academy bootcamp, I have expanded the content of the site to include musical projects as well as software engineering ones. I hope you enjoy using my website [here](https://evie-skinner18.github.io)! Please don't hesitate to give me feedback or submit an [issue](https://github.com/Evie-Skinner18/sparta-global-portfolio/issues), as I am always keen to improve.
